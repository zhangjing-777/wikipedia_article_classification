Overview[edit]
  Joan Rivers, performing at Udderbelly Festival 2009
Stand-up comedy consists of one-liners, stories, observations or shtick that may incorporate props, music, magic tricks, or ventriloquism. 
Stand-up comedy can be performed almost anywhere, including but not limited to clubs, festivals, bars, nightclubs, colleges or theatres.

History[edit]
Main article: History of stand-up comedy
Stand-up as a western art form has its roots in the traditions of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, from vaudeville, burlesque and English music hall.
The first documented use of stand-up as a term was in The Stage in 1911 describing a Miss Nellie Perrier delivering "'stand up' comic ditties in a chic and charming manner", describing a performance of comedy songs rather than stand-up comedy in true terms,
In the Yorkshire Evening Post of 10th November 1917, the "Stage Gossip" column described the career of Finlay Dunn. The article states Dunn played "as what he calls 'a stand-up comedian'". This usage is more convincing than the 1911 review of Nellie Perrier, as, although performing as a comedy piano act for most of his career, a favoured strand included joking about his large physical size, described as "good buffoonery in evening dress, with no accessories whatever", and, while the article was published in 1917, it refers to an earlier phase of his career. Dunn may have been a stand-up comedian in the very late part of the nineteenth century or the early twentieth century. It is also possible Dunn used the term retrospectively when recalling his past life, it is not clear exactly when his stand-up act was first performed.[1]

Genres[edit]
Main article: Comedic genres
Stand-up has multiple genres and styles with their own formats, rules and target audience. 

  Bill Bailey, British musical comedian
Some of these include:

Observational Pokes fun at everyday life, by observing the silliness of something that society accepts as normal.[2]
Character Derives humour from a persona invented by a performer; often from stereotypes
Comedy music derived from music with or without lyrics
Surreal humour bizarre juxtapositions, absurd situations, and nonsense logic strung through meandering stories.
Satire political figures, the establishment or ideology is subject to ridicule
Alternative comedy  a counter to the establishment entertainment figures from mainstream comedy.
DIY Comedy which is a "new alternative" to Alternative comedy.[3]
The Show[edit]
Phyllis Diller holds the record for most laughs per minute, at twelve.[4]

  Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, Dave Chappelle - on Broadway
Taylor Goodwin, holds the Guinness World Record for most jokes told in an hour, at 550.[5]
Lee Evans sold Â£7 million worth of tickets for his 2011 tour in a single day.[6]

Opener, feature, headliner[edit]
The host, compere or emcee (master of ceremonies) warms up the audience, makes announcements and introduces the other performers. This is followed by the opener, the feature, then the headliner. the emcee may also double as a opener for smaller shows.[7]

Open mic[edit]
Club and small venues often run open events; these slots may be booked in advance or left for walk-ins. Comics use open mics to work on material or to show off their skills to get a opener slot.[8] 
Bringer shows are open mics that require amateur performers to bring a specified number of paying guests to receive stage time. These shows are often showcase format.

The Circuit[edit]
Proven comics can get regular bookings for club chains and comedy venues. Jobbing stand-ups may perform sets at 2 or more venues in the same day

Festivals[edit]
As well as being a mainstay of the circuit these festivals often also showcase up and coming acts, promoters and agents may seek out new acts for bookings.[9]

Specials[edit]
Experienced comics with a popular following may produce a special. This is usually between 1 and two hours in duration and recorded on-tour or for one night only. It may be released as an audio recording on home video or on television and on-demand services.[10]

The Set[edit]
  Sara Pascoe performing at the Up the Creek Comedy Club, London
Main article: Theories of humourA stand-up defines their craft through the development of the routine.
The Routine[edit]
Stand-ups design their sets through the construction and revision of jokes, bits (linked jokes) and chunks (linked bits). The routine emerges from the arrangement of jokes, bits, and chunks may build an interlinked overarching theme leading to the closer. 
Most jokes are the juxtaposition of two incongruous things and made up of premise, set up, and punch line. often adding a twist, topper or tagline for an intensified or extra laugh. Delivery relies on the use of intonation, inflection, attitude and timing or other stylistic devices such as the rule of three. idiom, archetypes or wordplay.[11][12] Another popular joke structure is the paraprosdokian, a surprising punchline that changes the context or meaning of the setup.[13]
Stand-ups may use the jester's privilege, to absolve themselves for breaking social conventions or feign sincerity to frame their stories as true or having happened recently. Punching up and punching down describe who should be the butt of the joke. It carries the assumption that, relative to the comedian's socio-political identity, comedy should punch up at the powerful not punch down at the marginalized.[14][15] 

Joke Theft[edit]
Appropriation and plagiarism are considered social crimes by most stand-ups. There have been several high profile accusations of joke theft, some ending in lawsuit for copyright infringement. Those accused will sometimes claim cryptomnesia or parallel thinking,[16][17] however due to the idea/expression distinction it is difficult to successfully sue for joke theft.[18]

The Audience[edit]
  Ian Cognito using the Jester's privilege in 2013.Anna Spagnolli said "stand-up comedy audiences are both âco-constructors of the situationâ and âco-responsible for itâ"[19]
Jesters Privilege[edit]
Audiences enter into an unspoken contract, suspending the normal social rules and allowing unexpected, controversial or scandalous subjects. Their ability to understand the premise and appreciate it determines whether a joke produces a laugh or scathing disapproval.
Stand-up differs from most other performing arts in that the comedian is usually the only thing on-stage, is addressing the audience directly as a combined entity or as a group of individuals, the material while pre-written should be perceived as a spontaneous conversation, the performance only fully succeeds if these interactions are correctly balanced while both discouraging heckling and creating a sense of intimacy. 
Part of the appeal for an audience is in the appreciation of the skill of the comic's performance, as for most people the idea of standing on stage is extremely daunting. Similarly the shared communal experience of being part of an audience, the sense of intimacy, sharing an exclusive and unique event is a compelling and enjoyable aspect of the comedy show. 
The audience is integral to the experience of live comedy, both as a foil to the comedian and as a contributing factor to the overall quality of the experience, The use of canned laughter in television comedy reveals this, with shows often seeming dry or dull without it and may be filmed in front of a live audience for the same reason. [20]

Terms[edit]

On this circuit, shows generally consist of three to four comics: Headliner, Feature act, Opener and/or Emcee (i.e., Master of Ceremonies). The Headliner does roughly an hour of original material. The Feature act does 25-30 minutes. The Opener has a ten minute slot, and the Emcee squeezes in a joke or two between acts (if the Opener is not also acting as the Emcee)...
