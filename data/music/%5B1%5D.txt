Opera & Ballet · Theatre[edit]
It is strange to put it like this. Opera and Ballet are indeed theatrical genres. It is not something different from theatre. Instead of theatre I would put drama or I would merge all three terms under one term theatre (together with mime and puppetry mentioned as minor genres).
--Rudoleska (talk) 22:42, 24 February 2013 (UTC)

Ballet[edit]
Why is ballet identified as its own major form of performing art? Why not just put it in parentheses as a major and theatrical type of the major form of dance, like opera is in parentheses as a major and theatrical type of music?  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 71.245.160.77 (talk) 18:02, 21 June 2013 (UTC) 
Ballet is not the same as other forms of dance. Whether you like it or not Ballet is just as much theatre as it is dance. And it seems rather odd to have Opera on there without its sister art. Tahc what kind of sources would I need. You can't use sources on a template. Just read the Ballet article.-Rainbowofpeace (talk) 09:13, 13 October 2012 (UTC)

Just remove the opera then.
The lead from ballet is nothing like your description of ballet in your edit summary's. If there is a suitable passage from the article that is cited with a RS then just quote it here. Better yet quote the RS (a book on ballet or dance).
Hula says right in the lead than the "hula dramatizes or portrays the words... in a visual dance form." Do you also want hula listed? It makes a better case than ballet. tahc chat 11:04, 13 October 2012 (UTC)

These are all dictionary defintions of the word ballet almost all of them define ballet as theatrical or say it is dance and pantomime using costumes to tell a story.-Rainbowofpeace (talk) 11:31, 13 October 2012 (UTC)
"Speach"[edit]
This is a misspelling of "speech", not simply an alternate spelling. Can someone with the authority to fix it please do so?  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 75.150.107.166 (talk) 22:59, 9 November 2012 (UTC)

Music started from a bunch of white men standing in a circle hitting their drums.

Please replace

 * [[Puppetry]]
 ** [[Ventriloquism]] 

with

 * [[Puppetry]]&nbsp;([[ventriloquism]]) 

to avoid the word wrap (and correct the parenthesis grammar).

 Not done: There's been an intermediate edit that's done away with the nesting. Do you still want something changed? Alakzi (talk) 23:21, 12 April 2015 (UTC)
Professional wrestling[edit]
I have added professional wrestling to the template. If you would like to remove it, please outline your reasoning here. Interlaker (talk) 04:32, 11 April 2018 (UTC)

Fine, I'll count the third one. The first one is not a reliable source because its an opinion piece. The second one is much closer arguing its a form of theatre but doesn't explicitly call it a performing art. However I can't argue with the third one. I withdraw my objection. -Rainbowofpeace (talk) 08:37, 11 April 2018 (UTC)
