Geography[edit]
English is located at 38°20′8″N 86°27′38″W﻿ / ﻿38.33556°N 86.46056°W﻿ / 38.33556; -86.46056 (38.335626, -86.460564).[8]
According to the 2010 United States Census, English has a total area of 3.04 square miles (7.87 km2), all land.[9]

Climate[edit]
The climate in this area is characterized by highly variable fluctuations in weather with hot, humid summers and frigidly cold, generally wet winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, English previously had a humid continental climate, but as of the 2016 update it now has a humid subtropical climate due to climate change.[10] As Southern Indiana is in a transitional zone between these two areas, localized climate does not firmly adhere to either classification.[11]

History[edit]
English was called Hartford when it was laid out in 1839.[13] When the town incorporated in 1884 it was renamed English for William Hayden English, an Indiana politician of the day.[14] On December 28, 1893, the county seat of Crawford County was relocated from Leavenworth to English.
The first community was located at the confluence of two small rivers (Bird Dog Creek and Brownville Creek) with Blue River. It was a thriving community during the first half of the 20th century, with population rising to above 800 by 1950, but economic activity slowed thereafter (partly due to recurring flooding), and commercial establishments closed. Most residents now live on the higher ground surrounding the original settlement. A large swath of the previous inhabited level area has been converted into the Lucas Oil Golf Course.[15][16]
From 1959 to 1990, English suffered six floods. The town council decided that the only solution to the flooding problem was to move the town. 160 acres (0.65 km2) of high ground were purchased, a partnership was formed with Lincoln Hills Development Corporation, and a major portion of the town was relocated.[17]

Education[edit]
The Crawford County Public Library, one of two lending libraries in the county (the other is Breeden Memorial Library in Leavenworth), is located at English.[18]
