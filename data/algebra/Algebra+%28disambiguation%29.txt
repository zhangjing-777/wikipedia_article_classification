The bare word "algebra"[edit]
The bare word "algebra" may refer to:

Elementary algebra
Abstract algebra
Algebra over a field
In universal algebra, algebra has an axiomatic definition, roughly as an instance of any of a number of algebraic structures, such as groups, rings, etc.

Branches of mathematics[edit]
Elementary algebra, i.e. "high-school algebra"
Abstract algebra
Linear algebra
Relational algebra
Universal algebra
The term is also traditionally used for the field of:

Computer algebra, dealing with software systems for symbolic mathematical computation, which often offer capabilities beyond what is normally understood to be "algebra"
Mathematical structures[edit]
Vector space with multiplication[edit]
An "algebra", or to be verbose, an algebra over a field, is a vector space equipped with a bilinear vector product. Some notable algebras in this sense are:

In ring theory and linear algebra:
Algebra over a commutative ring, a module equipped with a bilinear product. Generalization of algebras over a field
Associative algebra, a module equipped with an associative bilinear vector product
Superalgebra, a 
  
    
      
        
          
            Z
          
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} _{2}}
  
-graded algebra
Lie algebras, Poisson algebras, and Jordan algebras, important examples of (potentially) nonassociative algebras
In functional analysis:
Banach algebra, an associative algebra A over the real or complex numbers which at the same time is also a Banach space
Operator algebra, continuous linear operators on a topological vector space with multiplication given by the composition
*-algebra, An algebra with a notion of adjoints
C*-algebra, a Banach algebra equipped with a unary involution operation
Von Neumann algebra (or W*-algebra)
See also coalgebra, the dual notion.

Other structures[edit]
A different class of "algebras" consists of objects which generalize logical connectives, sets, and lattices.

In logic:
Relational algebra, in which a set of finitary relations that is closed under certain operators
Boolean algebra and Boolean algebra (structure)
Heyting algebra
In measure theory:
Algebra over a set, a collection of sets closed under finite unions and complementation
Sigma algebra, a collection of sets closed under countable unions and complementation
"Algebra" can also describe more general structures:

In category theory and computer science:
F-algebra and F-coalgebra
T-algebra
Other uses[edit]
Algebra Blessett, singer from the U.S, goes by the stage name Algebra
