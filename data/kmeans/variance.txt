This diagram image could be re-created using vector graphics as an SVG file. This has several advantages; see Commons:Media for cleanup for more information. If an SVG form of this image is available, please upload it and afterwards replace this template with {{vector version available|new image name}}.
It is recommended to name the SVG file "K-means convergence to a local minimum.svg" – then the template Vector version available (or Vva) does not need the new image name parameter.
